There are many interesting programming languages, recent and historical.
This is my attempt to try a few more of them out as I go through this year's Advent of Code.
I will do a different language each day, going through them in alphabetical order, one for each letter.
For _Z_ I will do the resolve my favorite first and second problems from the year.
